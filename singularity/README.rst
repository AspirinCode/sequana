Notes
=======

Jan 2018. ruamel.yaml installed is 0.12.13. In the requirements, right now we
have ruamel.yaml<=0.15 as recommended in the ruamel.yaml doc. l
ocally I (TC) use version 0.15 without trouble but in the singularity, somehow,
it is version 0.12.13 and this causes an error in the sequanix interface.
