# Quality trimming and adapter removal
#
# If a design_file is provided the forward and reverse complement adapters
# are automatically extracted from this file (given the sample name contained
# in the filenames). In such case, the fwd and rev fields are ignored.
#
# If there is no design_file, the fwd and rev fields are used. It can be a
# string, or a filename. If a filename, it must be prefixed with "file:" to
# specify that it is a file and not a string. If the tool is cutadapt, the empty
# fwd and rev fields means that no adapters are to be used.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - adapter_type: can only be one of PCRFree, Nextera, Rubicon, TruSeq.
#   Only used if design_file is provided.
# - design_file: a valid CSV file with mapping of index and sample name
# - fwd: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - m: 20 means discard trimmed reads that are shorter than 20.
#         must be > 0
# - quality: 0 means no trimming, 30 means keep base with quality

# This step allows to perform the peak calling
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - tool_choice:  only MACS2 supported for now
# - genomeSize: It's the mappable genome size or effective genome size which is defined
#                as the genome size which can be sequenced. Because of the repetitive
#                 features on the chromsomes, the actual mappable genome size will be smaller
#                 than the original size, about 90% or 70% of the genome size.
#                 The default hs -- 2.7e9 is recommended for UCSC human hg18 assembly
# - readLength: While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3'
#                direction to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region
#                for your transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building
#                by MACS, this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel
#                is set or when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.
# - qval: The qvalue (minimum FDR) cutoff to call significant regions. Default is 0.05.
#          For broad marks, you can try 0.05 as cutoff. Q-values are calculated from p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
# - options: any options recognised by peak calling tool
# - split_nucFree: if unchecked, calling will be perform on all fragments, otherwise, peak calling will be perform on
#                  nucleosome-free and all fragments, respectively.
# - nucFree_length: length to select all nucleosome-free fragments

## BAM Coverage
#############################################################################
# bamCoverage write file in bigwig format from BAM files.
# This tool takes an alignment of reads or fragments as input (BAM file) and
# generates a coverage track (bigWig or bedGraph) as output. The coverage is
# calculated as the number of reads per bin, where bins are short consecutive
# counting windows of a defined size. It is possible to extended the length of
# the reads to better reflect the actual fragment length. *bamCoverage* offers
# normalization by scaling factor, Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
# (RPKM), and 1x depth (reads per genome coverage, RPGC).
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - binSize: Size of the bins, in bases, for the output of the
#            bigwig/bedgraph file. (default: 50)
# - genomeSize: Report read coverage normalized to 1x sequencing depth
#                        (also known as Reads Per Genomic Content (RPGC)).
#                        Sequencing depth is defined as: (total number of
#                        mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome
#                        size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the
#                        sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the
#                        1x coverage. To use this option, the effective genome
#                        size has to be indicated after the option. The
#                        effective genome size is the portion of the genome
#                        that is mappable.
# - extendReads: This parameter allows the extension of reads to
#                fragment size.
# - minFragmentLength: The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. Note that a value other than 0 will exclude
#                      all single-end reads.
# - maxFragmentLength: The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. A value of 0 disables filtering and is
#                      needed for including single-end and orphan reads.
# - threads: number of threads to be used
# - options: any options recognised by bamCoverage tools

## plotHeatmap
#############################################################################
# plotHeatmap is part of DEEPTools.
# This tool creates a heatmap for scores associated with genomic regions.
# The program requires a matrix file generated by the tool computeMatrix.
# This tool calculates scores per genome regions and prepares an intermediate
# file that can be used with plotHeatmap and plotProfiles. Typically, the genome regions are genes,
# but any other regions defined in a BED file can be used. computeMatrix accepts multiple score files
# (bigWig format) and multiple regions files (BED format). This tool can also be used to filter and sort
# regions according to their score.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - regionsFileName: File name or names, in BED or GTF format, containing the regions to plot.
#                   If multiple bed files are given, each one is considered a group that can be plotted separately.
#                   Also, adding a “#” symbol in the bed file causes all the regions until the previous “#” to be considered one group.
# - options-heatmap: any options recognised by plotHeatmap tools
