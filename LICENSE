About the Copyright Holders
===============================

Version 1.0 of Sequana was originally developed by Thomas Cokelaer 
and Dimitri Desvillechabrol. 

The Sequana Developement Team is the collection of developers that
contributed to the development of Sequana, which includes code and
documentation. 

Full credits for Sequana Developement Team can be found in the 
documentation or source code.

Sequana uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Sequana. However, it is important to note that
these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the Sequana source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire Sequana Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the Sequana repositories.
With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
